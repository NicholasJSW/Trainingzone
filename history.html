  Anyone got  a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be  manageable. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  You are the one who is responsible for getting work done.
    <li>Attending a lecture and gathering notes from others</li>
  <li>Find a friend in a lecture that you       missed and get them to tell you what else was covered taught in that lecture.</li>
  <li>Which one/s did you miss? - A few      ideas to help you with making this decision are: </li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>If you miss one out of two        lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%. </li>
    <li>Which one are you most ahead        of? </li>
    <li>Which subject has the most        complete lecture notes? </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Don't ask your lecturer -       &quot;Is there anything important that I missed?&quot; If you didn't miss       anything, there'd be no point to lectures.</li>
</ul>
