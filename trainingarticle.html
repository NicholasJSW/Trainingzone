  Probably  the most misused and abused and disused management tool in history is the  performance appraisal. It's difficult to figure out. Ask any manager or human  resources person whether they think performance appraisal is an important thing  to do, they are almost unanymous. &quot;Certaintly/Without a doubt&quot;, are common  responses. If you ask why it's important, they will repeat it over and over again.<br>
  The odd  thing is that they barely get done, and managers, supervisors and  employees hate them. Human resource professionals spend a lot of  time whipping people into doing them, while managers look for a variety of  reasons to delay them. Why would they do that?<br>
  It's  uncomfortable and frustrating to do performance appraisals. But why is it uncomfortable?  Because people undertake them for the varying reasons and have the wrong perspective,  which ends up putting the manager and the employee at a different table. Appraisals are used for determining an employees payrate, who will no longer work here or there and who gets a promotion. Often they are used to show people what they need to change..<br>
  There is a reason for performance appraisals, and here is a valuable piece of information that says why. A performance appraisal will focus on improving a person for the future to reach a goal and become a great worker and it's not just for the employee, the managers take information from employees to make the employees more productive. an organization or a group will indentify any problems that will cause the employees to become unproductive.<br>
  If we move away from blaming people for certain things, to finding barriers to improving a person or groups performance, appraisal's are no longer something people become anxious about. as we focus on whats happening now and what will happen later, a better future becomes clearer and what is better will be clearer.<br>
